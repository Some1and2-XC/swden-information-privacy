            <h1>Ethical Practices</h1>
            <p>
                To get an understanding of the ethical practices of the Swedish government it is important to
                look at how the swedish government handles its policies around its own initiatives. One good
                example is healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, there was a reform to the Swedish healthcare system which takes inspiration from
                the free market and was based on three principles.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"freedom-of-choice"</li>
                <li>"any-qualified-provider"</li>
                <li>"money-follows-the-patient-principle"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first principle, "freedom-of-choice" refers to the attitude that patients have the right
                to choose freely which primary care center they prefer. The purpose of this is to give more
                power to the patient in how they want to be treated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second principle, "any-qualitfied-provider" was inspired by the open market and this
                principle gives private organizations the ability to compete for public reimbursements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third principle, "money-follows-the-patient-principle" indicates the patients choices should
                impact the allocation of resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing that all three of these reforms have in common is that they give more choice to the
                Swedish people. They also are a reflection of the Swedish government putting policies in place to
                make sure that the taxes that are received go towards things that improve the lives of the people.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this is an example of how the Swedish government allocates resource to help its people
                (as Sweden is a democracy this is expected,) it is also important to take a closer look at what
                studies made specifically for looking at the ethics of Sweden have to say.
            </p>

            <h2>The status of ethics in Swedish health care management: a qualitative study</h2>
            <p>
                Here is the contents of the 'background' section of this study.
                The background of the study states:
            </p>

                <br />
                By tradition, the Swedish health care system is based on a representative and parliamentary
                form of government. Recently, new management forms, inspired by market principles, have developed.
                The steering system is both national and regional, in that self-governing county councils are responsible
                for the financing and provision of health care in different regions. National and local documents
                regulating Swedish health care mention several ethical values, such as equity in health for the whole
                population and respect for autonomy and human dignity. It is therefore of interest to investigate the
                status of such ethical statements in Swedish health care management.

            <p>
                To summarize, this study will look at how the Swedish healthcare industry's treatment of its citizens
                in practice aligns with the ethics of values of the Swedish government. The following sections are going
                to cover some of this study's findings.
            </p>

            <h3>Low Status of Ethics</h3>
            <p>
                Here is a quote from an individual labeled by the study as 'Politician 2'.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                I would say that the ethical code is hardly ever discussed in our county. The Swedish Health Care Act is
                the very foundation of our work, and one of the main pillar of that law is that the patient most in need
                of care should be prioritized. But we never have that type of discussions, I would say.
                <br />
                " (Politician 2)
                </i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Of course, as this is a quote from a politician it is important to have the understanding that they
                can potentially benefit from having a study corroborate things they campaign for.
            </p>
            <p>
                This quote does however give the sense ethics aren't much of a priority for some policy decisions in which
                ethics absolutely should play a role.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is another quote, instead from 'politician 1'.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                My opinion is that the status of the Health Care Act is far too weak. I mean, it should be superior to all
                other laws. It is the law that should govern all our work within health care, both here in the county and in the
                whole of Sweden. But, as a matter of fact, that is not the case.
                <br />
                " (Politician 1)
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This quote seems as if the speaker is disapointed in how the health care act turned out. This can indicate that
                from this politicians perspective, they could have done more to ensure that Swedens policies always have the
                patient in mind when being decided upon.
            </p>

            <h3>Cost Effectiveness over Ethics</h3>
            <p>
                One theme the study found was that the people the study interviewed had the perspective that the economy and KPIs
                such as the amount of hospital visits and volumes of supplies. The study however implies that the KPIs and metrics
                that get used the most often have very little to do with ethics.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                There’s a lot of focus on hard facts. /---/ Economism, number of health care visits, and volumes of this and that.
                <br />
                " (CEO 1)
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The study categorized such quotes as the informants describing the effects of marketization. Implies that
                there are drawbacks associated with some of the reforms.
            </p>

            <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
            <p>
                While the study points out various aspects of the Swedish healthcare system that need improvement, the fact that
                there is investigation into how well parts of its government operates shows transparency which can't be overlooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                It should also be noted that while the study does showcase the downsides of having healthcare's private and public sector
                compete, it is important to remember that the purpose of the original reforms seems to be an attempt at making
                the budget for healthcare more effective.
            </p>

            <h2>IMR and Healthcare Effectiveness</h2>
            <p>
                To take a look at the Swedish healthcare system with a wider lens, comparisons should be made to similar systems.
                One metric often used to compare how effective a healthcare system is for countries is the IMR (or infant mortality rate.)
                The following is a sample of data provided by the CIA.
            </p>

                This table shows Sweden beating many other first world countries. Out of the 227 countries listed,
                Sweden is listed 218 or the 10th best country when it comes to IMR. This shows that even though
                there are concerns about the role of ethics in the policies and procedures when it comes to Swedish
                healthcare, Sweden does have one of the best healthcare systems in the world.

            <h1>Legislative Practices</h1>
            <h2>EU & Article 8</h2>
            <p>
                Because Sweden is a member of the EU, may laws in
                regard to data privacy and information is simply the same as the rest of the European Union. 
                Because Sweden is a member of the EU, this section is going to go over some of the laws the EU
                has in place for its member states.
            </p>
            <p>
                The European Union has the “Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.”
                Title III Article 8 from their chart of rights called “Protection of personal data” says the following:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                    "
                    <br />
                    Article 8
                    <br />
                    Protection of personal data
                    <br />
                    1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
                    <br />
                    2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the
                    person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to
                    data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
                    <br />
                    3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
                    <br />
                    "
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This is put in place to guarantee the rights of the citizens living in the EU's member states.
                This list of rights are very permissive for the rights to privacy for individuals especially
                in the modern day.
            </p>

            <h2>IMY & GDPR</h2>
            <p>
                For Sweden, the 'independent authority' which is required by article 8 is the IMY.
                The IMY (which stands for Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection, its a swedish acronym.)
                The IMY in Sweden is responsible for ensuring individuals personal privacy is being respected.
                The organization is also repsonsible for guiding organizations to comply with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation.)
                The IMY has the authority to place expensive fines on organizations for breaching its policies.
                Here is an example of the IMY going after google for a breach of their data governance laws.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                    "
                    <br />
                    Gothenburg Administrative Court of Appeal, case nr 2232-21. In this case, Google LLC was fined for
                    not fulfilling its obligations in respect of the right to request delisting (right to be forgotten under the
                    GDPR). The Court affirmed the fine set by the Stockholm Administrative Court, but lowered it from
                    SEK 52 million (approx. €4.46 million) to SEK 50 million (approx. €4.29 million). The fine was
                    lowered as the Court ruled that Google had not violated any provisions of the GDPR with reference to
                    the individual complaints, but only with reference to its internal procedures. Google appealed the
                    decision, but on 20 December 2022, the Supreme Administrative Court decided not to grant leave to
                    appeal;
                    <br />
                    "
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                While the fine was lowered, to SEK 50 million (around CA$ 6.3 million,) this still shows how the IMY does
                take steps to try and enforce their information privacy laws to ensure the privacy of its citizens.

            <h1>Ethical Practices</h1>
            <p>
                To get an understanding of the ethical practices of the Swedish government it is important to
                look at how the swedish government handles its policies around its own initiatives. One good
                example is healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, there was a reform to the Swedish healthcare system which takes inspiration from
                the free market and was based on three principles.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"freedom-of-choice"</li>
                <li>"any-qualified-provider"</li>
                <li>"money-follows-the-patient-principle"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first principle, "freedom-of-choice" refers to the attitude that patients have the right
                to choose freely which primary care center they prefer. The purpose of this is to give more
                power to the patient in how they want to be treated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second principle, "any-qualitfied-provider" was inspired by the open market and this
                principle gives private organizations the ability to compete for public reimbursements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third principle, "money-follows-the-patient-principle" indicates the patients choices should
                impact the allocation of resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing that all three of these reforms have in common is that they give more choice to the
                Swedish people. They also are a reflection of the Swedish government putting policies in place to
                make sure that the taxes that are received go towards things that improve the lives of the people.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this is an example of how the Swedish government allocates resource to help its people
                (as Sweden is a democracy this is expected,) it is also important to take a closer look at what
                studies made specifically for looking at the ethics of Sweden have to say.
            </p>

            <h2>The status of ethics in Swedish health care management: a qualitative study</h2>
            <p>
                Here is the contents of the 'background' section of this study.
                The background of the study states:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                By tradition, the Swedish health care system is based on a representative and parliamentary
                form of government. Recently, new management forms, inspired by market principles, have developed.
                The steering system is both national and regional, in that self-governing county councils are responsible
                for the financing and provision of health care in different regions. National and local documents
                regulating Swedish health care mention several ethical values, such as equity in health for the whole
                population and respect for autonomy and human dignity. It is therefore of interest to investigate the
                status of such ethical statements in Swedish health care management.

            <p>
                To summarize, this study will look at how the Swedish healthcare industry's treatment of its citizens
                in practice aligns with the ethics of values of the Swedish government. The following sections are going
                to cover some of this study's findings.
            </p>

            <h3>Low Status of Ethics</h3>
            <p>
                Here is a quote from an individual labeled by the study as 'Politicial 2'.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                “
                ethical code is hardly ever discussed in our country
                ”. (Politician 2)
                </i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Of course, as this is a quote from a politician it is important to have the understanding that they
                can potentially benefit from having a study corroborate things they campaign for.
            </p>

            <h3>Cost Effectiveness over Ethics</h3>

            <h3>Separation of Ethics from Management</h3>

            <h3>Lack of Opportunities for Ethical Competence Building</h3>

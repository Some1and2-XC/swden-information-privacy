            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                Sweden, renowned for its progressive policies and high standard of living, offers a fascinating case study in ethical
                governance, legislative practices, and cultural dynamics. In exploring various facets of Swedish society, ranging from
                healthcare management to data privacy laws and political activism, we gain valuable insights into the nation's values,
                priorities, and unique approach to governance.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the heart of Sweden's ethical framework lies a commitment to principles such as freedom of choice and equity in
                healthcare access. These principles are exemplified in the country's healthcare system, where patients are empowered
                to choose their care providers, and resources are allocated based on individual preferences. However, recent studies
                have shed light on potential shortcomings in the implementation of ethical values within healthcare management,
                prompting deeper reflections on the intersection of policy and ethics.
            </p>

            <p>
                Legislatively, Sweden navigates its position within the European Union while upholding its own national standards.
                Compliance with EU regulations, particularly in the realm of data protection, underscores Sweden's dedication to
                safeguarding individual privacy rights. The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) plays a pivotal role in
                enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ensuring accountability and transparency in data handling
                practices.
            </p>

            <p>
                Culturally, Sweden's progressive values are reflected in its political landscape and societal norms. The prominence
                of women in the Riksdag and the country's high rankings in social progress indices attest to Sweden's commitment to
                inclusivity and social welfare. Moreover, grassroots movements, such as the Swedish Pirate Party, advocate for
                digital rights and challenge traditional paradigms, showcasing a vibrant culture of activism and civic engagement.
            </p>

            <p>
                This exploration of Sweden's ethical, legislative, and cultural landscape offers valuable insights into the nation's
                identity and governance philosophy. By delving into the intricacies of Swedish society, we gain a deeper understanding
                of the factors that contribute to its reputation as a unique and progressive nation on the global stage.

            <h1>Ethical Practices</h1>
            <p>
                To get an understanding of the ethical practices of the Swedish government it is important to
                look at how the swedish government handles its policies around its own initiatives. One good
                example is healthcare.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2010, there was a reform to the Swedish healthcare system which takes inspiration from
                the free market and was based on three principles.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>"freedom-of-choice"</li>
                <li>"any-qualified-provider"</li>
                <li>"money-follows-the-patient-principle"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The first principle, "freedom-of-choice" refers to the attitude that patients have the right
                to choose freely which primary care center they prefer. The purpose of this is to give more
                power to the patient in how they want to be treated.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second principle, "any-qualitfied-provider" was inspired by the open market and this
                principle gives private organizations the ability to compete for public reimbursements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third principle, "money-follows-the-patient-principle" indicates the patients choices should
                impact the allocation of resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                The thing that all three of these reforms have in common is that they give more choice to the
                Swedish people. They also are a reflection of the Swedish government putting policies in place to
                make sure that the taxes that are received go towards things that improve the lives of the people.
            </p>
            <p>
                While this is an example of how the Swedish government allocates resources to help its people
                (as Sweden is a democracy this is expected,) it is also important to take a closer look at what
                studies made specifically for looking at the ethics of Sweden have to say.
            </p>

            <h2>The status of ethics in Swedish health care management: a qualitative study</h2>
            <p>
                Here is the contents of the 'background' section of this study.
                The background of the study states:
            </p>
            <blockquote>

                <br />
                By tradition, the Swedish health care system is based on a representative and parliamentary
                form of government. Recently, new management forms, inspired by market principles, have developed.
                The steering system is both national and regional, in that self-governing county councils are responsible
                for the financing and provision of health care in different regions. National and local documents
                regulating Swedish health care mention several ethical values, such as equity in health for the whole
                population and respect for autonomy and human dignity. It is therefore of interest to investigate the
                status of such ethical statements in Swedish health care management.
                <br />

            <p>
                To summarize, this study will look at how the Swedish healthcare industry's treatment of its citizens
                in practice aligns with the ethics of values of the Swedish government. The following sections are going
                to cover some of this study's findings.
            </p>

            <h3>Low Status of Ethics</h3>
            <p>
                Here is a quote from an individual labeled by the study as 'Politician 2'.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                I would say that the ethical code is hardly ever discussed in our county. The Swedish Health Care Act is
                the very foundation of our work, and one of the main pillar of that law is that the patient most in need
                of care should be prioritized. But we never have that type of discussions, I would say.
                <br />
                " (Politician 2)
                </i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Of course, as this is a quote from a politician it is important to have the understanding that they
                can potentially benefit from having a study corroborate things they campaign for.
            </p>
            <p>
                This quote does however give the sense ethics aren't much of a priority for some policy decisions in which
                ethics absolutely should play a role.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here is another quote, instead from 'politician 1'.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                My opinion is that the status of the Health Care Act is far too weak. I mean, it should be superior to all
                other laws. It is the law that should govern all our work within health care, both here in the county and in the
                whole of Sweden. But, as a matter of fact, that is not the case.
                <br />
                " (Politician 1)
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This quote seems as if the speaker is disapointed in how the health care act turned out. This can indicate that
                from this politicians perspective, they could have done more to ensure that Swedens policies always have the
                patient in mind when being decided upon.
            </p>

            <h3>Cost Effectiveness over Ethics</h3>
            <p>
                One theme the study found was that the people the study interviewed had the perspective that the economy and KPIs
                such as the amount of hospital visits and volumes of supplies didn't always favor the patient. The study
                implies that the KPIs and metrics that get used the most often have very little to do with ethics.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                There’s a lot of focus on hard facts. /---/ Economism, number of health care visits, and volumes of this and that.
                <br />
                " (CEO 1)
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                The study categorized such quotes as the informants describing the effects of marketization. Implies that
                there are drawbacks associated with some of the reforms.
            </p>

            <h3>Key takeaways</h3>
            <p>
                While the study points out various aspects of the Swedish healthcare system that need improvement, the fact that
                there is investigation into how well parts of its government operates shows transparency which can't be overlooked.
            </p>
            <p>
                It should also be noted that while the study does showcase the downsides of having healthcare's private and public sector
                compete, it is important to remember that the purpose of the original reforms seems to be an attempt at making
                the budget for healthcare more effective.
            </p>

            <h2>IMR and Healthcare Effectiveness</h2>
            <p>
                To take a look at the Swedish healthcare system with a wider lens, comparisons should be made to similar systems.
                One metric often used to compare how effective a healthcare system is for countries is the IMR (or infant mortality rate.)
                The following is a sample of data provided by the CIA.
            </p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <td><b>Country</b></td>
                    <td><b>IMR (deaths/1,000 live births)</b></td>
                    <td><b>Date of Information</b></td>

                        <td>2024 est.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>United States</td>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p>
                This table shows Sweden beating many other first world countries. Out of the 227 countries listed,
                Sweden is listed 218 or the 10th best country when it comes to IMR. This shows that even though
                there are concerns about the role of ethics in the policies and procedures when it comes to Swedish
                healthcare, Sweden does have one of the best healthcare systems in the world.

            <h1>Legislative Practices</h1>
            <h2>EU & Article 8</h2>
            <p>
                Because Sweden is a member of the EU, many laws in
                regard to data privacy and information is simply the same as the rest of the European Union. 
                This section is going to go over some of the laws the EU has in place for its member states.
            </p>
            <p>
                The European Union has the “Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.”
                Title III Article 8 from their charter of rights called “Protection of personal data” says the following:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                    "
                    <br />
                    Article 8
                    <br />
                    Protection of personal data
                    <br />
                    1. Everyone has the right to the protection of personal data concerning him or her.
                    <br />
                    2. Such data must be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the
                    person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by law. Everyone has the right of access to
                    data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.
                    <br />
                    3. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to control by an independent authority.
                    <br />
                    "
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                This is put in place to guarantee the rights of the citizens living in the EU's member states.
                This list of rights are very permissive for the rights to privacy for individuals especially
                in the modern day.
            </p>

            <h2>IMY & GDPR</h2>
            <p>
                For Sweden, the 'independent authority' which is required by article 8 is the IMY.
                The IMY (which stands for Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection, its a swedish acronym.)
                The IMY in Sweden is responsible for ensuring individuals personal privacy is being respected.
                The organization is also responsible for guiding organizations to comply with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation.)
                The IMY has the authority to place expensive fines on organizations for breaching its policies.
                Here is an example of the IMY going after google for a breach of their data governance laws.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <i>
                    "
                    <br />
                    Gothenburg Administrative Court of Appeal, case nr 2232-21. In this case, Google LLC was fined for
                    not fulfilling its obligations in respect of the right to request delisting (right to be forgotten under the
                    GDPR). The Court affirmed the fine set by the Stockholm Administrative Court, but lowered it from
                    SEK 52 million (approx. €4.46 million) to SEK 50 million (approx. €4.29 million). The fine was
                    lowered as the Court ruled that Google had not violated any provisions of the GDPR with reference to
                    the individual complaints, but only with reference to its internal procedures. Google appealed the
                    decision, but on 20 December 2022, the Supreme Administrative Court decided not to grant leave to
                    appeal;
                    <br />
                    "
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                While the fine was lowered, to SEK 50 million (around CAD 6.3 million,) this still shows how the IMY does
                take steps to try and enforce their information privacy laws to ensure the privacy of its citizens.
            </p>

            <h2>Riksdag</h2>
            <p>
                The Riksdag is the Swedish parliament. This is required as Sweden is a parliamentary democracy.
                The purpose of the Riksdag is to make decisions about laws to be put in place as well as to ammend the Swedish
                constitution when needed.

            <h1>Cultural Practices</h1>
            <p>
                To understand the culture of Sweden, it is important to understand the political landscape of Sweden.
                Sweden is considered relatively progressive, having 47.3 per cent of women representation in the Riksdag
                after the 2018 election. Sweden is also ranked 7th on the social progress index put out by American non-profit
                <a href="https://www.socialprogress.org/social-progress-index-time-series/" target="_blank">socialprogress.org</a> in 2020.

            <h2>The Pew Research Fact Sheet</h2>
            <p>
                There is also a fact sheet put out by
                <a
                    href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/news-media-and-political-attitudes-in-sweden/"
                    target="_blank"
                >pew research</a>
                which describes how Swedish people view the media.
                This fact sheet has some interesting findings. To start, Sweden doesn't seem to have the same left/right divide
                that is seen in North America, especially when it comes to the trust in media. This fact sheet
                shows that an attribute that differentiates Swedish people the most is how populist the individual is.
                This is shown in
                <a
                    href="https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/05/PJ_18.04.16_MediaPolitics_FactSheet_OutletTrustByPopAndIdeol_Sweden.png"
                    target="_blank"
                >this graphic</a>.
                This fact sheet also shows that Swedish people generally trust the Swedish media outlets.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to remember that even though high level information such as this is accessible, that doesn't mean
                that everyone from Sweden is going to fall into these categorizations.
            </p>

            <h2>Piratbyr&aring;n</h2>
            <p>
                The Swedish pirate party is a political party founded in 2006. From a web snapshot taken in 2009 from
                archive.org, their original website had 3 issues it was fighting for.
            </p>
            <h3>#1 Reform copyright law</h3>
            <p>
                In this section, the pirate party argues that copyright laws restrict the thing that they were trying to
                promote. They argue that the system is outdated and that it isn’t fair that there is "no point in restoring
                balance and reason to the legislation, if at the same time we continue to allow the big media companies
                to both write and enforce their own arbitrary laws."
            </p>

            <h3>#2 An abolished patent system</h3>
            <p>
                In this section they argue that pharmaceutical patents are extremely harmful and get in the way of
                helping people. The pirate party says that having researchers lock up their findings in a patent causes
                people to die because their research isn’t freely available.
            </p>

            <h3>#3 Respect the right to privacy</h3>
            <p>
                This section states that Europeans should be aware of the horrific consequences of not taking privacy
                seriously. It states that "We must pull the emergency brake on the runaway train towards a society we
                do not want," meaning the mass surveillance done by the state must be stopped and that there is dire
                consequences of not acting.
            </p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
                The current version of their website is far more toned down with some revisions. In the Reform
                copyright law section it says this “The non-profit copyright must remain unchanged.” It also adds that
                it wants to reform library lending. They state they want to remove lending caps and DRM on E-books.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outrage over a new copyright law and convictions over the four founders of the pirate bay in 2009
                caused a surge in popularity for the niche pirate party causing its size to more than double, winning
                7.1% of the votes in Sweden and one of Swedens 18 seats in the European Unions parliament. While
                the founders of the pirate bay were convicted, in Sweden if you appeal a conviction you don't get
                incarcerated until after the appeal process. Further more according to an interview with Peter Sunde a
                co-founder of the pirate bay, in Sweden you aren’t required to assist with getting incarcerated as that is
                the job of the state.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>
                "
                <br />
                Interesting thing in Sweden is that it is not illegal to not go to prison, so when you get sentenced to
                prison, I think this is actually the case in most countries. Is that you're not the ones getting sentenced.
                You can’t force someone to go to prison. There is no human emotion that says I want to be locked in.
                So in Sweden at least, it the state that gets sentenced to put you in prison, not you as a person. The state
                has the responsibility of locking you up, you don’t have to help whatsoever. Which also means its not
                illegal in Sweden to escape from prison. Because its a human trait that you don’t want to be locked up
                <br />
                "
                </i>
            </blockquote>

            <p>

                In Sweden, it seems as though many parts of its legislation center around natural human behavior.
                Because of quirks such as these the pirate bay, while still constantly being threatened by DMCAs and
                American copyright holders (with lots of effort) can still exist to this day.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>
                A part of the culture of the Sweden population is to respect personal privacy and to respect human
                nature. Because of this, certain things can happen that seems impossible to do in most other places in
                the world. Not helping with the state to lock you up and even escaping from prison carrying no penalty
                at all while at the same time giving out multi million dollar fines to companies that don't allow users to
                remove their information is something that doesn't seem possible in the same country.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of the laws regarding data security are taken very seriously and have steep penalties for not following
                guidelines. The Swedish government also works very well and this is shown by the effectiveness of its healthcare system.
                This is what makes Sweden a terribly unique and interesting country.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, the exploration of Sweden's ethical, legislative, and cultural landscape offers valuable insights
                into the nation's identity and governance philosophy. By navigating the complexities of Swedish society, we gain a
                deeper appreciation for its unique blend of progressive values, legislative frameworks, and civic activism, which
                collectively contribute to its reputation as a global leader in ethical governance and societal well-being.
